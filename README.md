### Project Configuration Manager.
This Visual Studio extension lets you manage your solution and project configurations in one place. 
Forget about clicking through all the tabs in all the property pages - see all your projects and configurations on one grid. 
Color highlighting let's you verify at a glance if the configurations of your projects are consistent. 
Initialize new projects by simply copy/paste defaults from other projects.
